Stock Price Prediction Project
This repository contains code and data for a stock price prediction project using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The project downloads historical stock data, preprocesses it, trains an LSTM model, makes future price predictions, and visualizes the results.

Contents
v0.1_edited.ipynb: Main notebook for data fetching, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.
stock_prediction.ipynb: Additional notebook with further data processing and prediction results.
Historical data and prediction CSV files generated by the notebooks (saved after running).

Features
  * Fetches historical stock price data using Yahoo Finance.
  * Preprocesses data with scaling and sequence creation for LSTM inputs.
  * Builds and trains an LSTM-based neural network for time series forecasting.
  * Predicts future stock prices for a configurable number of days.
  * Visualizes stock price candlestick charts, high/low prices, and predicted vs actual prices.
  * Saves historical and predicted prices to CSV files for further analysis.

Requirements
Python 3.10+

Packages:
  numpy
  pandas
  matplotlib
  yfinance
  mplfinance
  scikit-learn
  tensorflow/keras

You can install the necessary packages using:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Create requirements.txt with package names from the notebooks if needed.)

Usage
Open v0.1_edited.ipynb (or stock_prediction.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Set the target stock ticker, date range, and model parameters (TIME_STEP, FUTURE_DAYS, etc.) in the configuration section.
Run the cells sequentially to download data, preprocess, train the LSTM model, and generate predictions.
View plots for stock prices and prediction performance.
Exported CSV files will be saved to the designated folder for historical and predictive data.

Notes
The LSTM model trains for multiple epochs with dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
The time steps and future days for prediction can be adjusted.
The repository currently targets specific stocks (e.g., CBA.AX, AMZN) but can be adapted for others.
The notebooks include detailed comments for customizing and extending the workflow.
